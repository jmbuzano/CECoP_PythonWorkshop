    "# Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data type representation is a way to identify different type of value that could be required depending on the problem to be solved. What happens when you have to repeat a certain piece of code several times? First, it makes the code bigger and takes away one of the most important principles of Python coding such as readability. Also, it is heavily saying that the data _per sé_ needs to be handled in a different way. For instance:\n",

    "var_b = 98\n",
    "var_c = 99\n",
    "var_d = 100\n",
    "var_e = 101\n",
    "var_f = 102\n",
    "var_g = 103\n",
    "# ... \n",
    "var_y = 121\n",
    "var_z = 122\n",
    "\n",
    "# 32 is the distance from lower case chars to become upper case.\n",
    "def to_upper(char):\n",
    "    return char - 32\n",

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one of the most used data structure in Python. They provide enough functions and interactions so they have become an essential part of the language. Knowing about it can solve many issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The language _per sé_ will give us some key functions in order to work with the lists. In this section we will describe their usages. See them below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method  | Description |\n",
    "| ------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| append  | Inserts at the end.|\n",
    "| insert  | Inserts at the specified position.|\n",
    "| pop     | Removes the last element, or the one you specify. This also returns the element.|\n",
    "| remove  | Removes the first found item that is equal to the specified value.|\n",
    "| reverse | Reverses the list.|\n",
    "| sort    | Sorts the list.|\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some other functions that can be used on the lists that are not being mentioned here. \n",
    "The language also provides functions that work over collections such as _len_ that allow us to get the size of the list. To see the full reference, visit https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays\n",
    "There is no differentiation between linked lists and arrays in Python, but it provides all the facilities for it to be threted as an array. Items can be addressed with accessors:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This creates an empty array. If we try to assign a value to any position, it will flag an error.\n",
    "array = []\n",
    "# Now let's play a little bit with the language to populate the array.\n",
    "array = [0] * 5 # This creates a list of 5 elements, all of them 0.\n",
    "print(f\"array={array}\")\n",
    "# Once the elements are reserved in memory, then we can play with the accessors.\n",
    "array[0] = 1\n",
    "# The following line uses the accessor ('[', ']') to obtain the value of the first element.\n",
    "print(f\"array[0]={array[0]}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can notice, mutability is one of the features from this data structure that is relevant to highlight since it will allow us to modify the contained values once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's transform our first code snippet into a list to see how much the code is going to be reduced and reused."

Also, it is important to mention that tuples allow duplicated values and they are ordered.\n",
